First install "virtualenv" if you haven't installed before.


go to the command prompt and give following command:

	pip install virtualenv

make sure it is installed successfully

"virtualenv" is used to create your virtual environment.



Create virtual environment

go to the folder where you want to create virtual environment

e.g. in my case it is
e:\\temp

give following command :

e:\temp>virtualenv myenv (to create virtual environment)

here "myenv" is the name of virtual environment to be created inside "temp" folder.
check inside "temp" directory whether "myenv" folder has been created or not

go to pycharm and close your currently running project.

restart pycharm

click on "New Project" button

	from "Location", select
			E:\temp\myenv

from the available radio buttons , select
	New Environment Using - Virtualenv

don't select "Create main.py welcome script"

	click on "Create" button to create the project.

if you get "Directory is not empty" dialog box,
	click on "Create from existing Sources" button

make sure it creates a project successfully.

now click on "Terminal" tab from the bottom window

change the directory to 
	e:\\temp\\myenv

now let's install Django 4.2 inside our virtual environment. In order to do that first we have to activate our virtual environment

To install any library (like Django) into a virtual environment, you must first activate that environment. This ensures that the library is installed specifically in that isolated environment, avoiding conflicts with other projects or the global installation.

now let's activate (myenv) our virtual environment

e:\temp\myenv>  scripts\activate  (to activate the environment)
	if this command gives you error"

	"cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system"

to solve this error,give following command :

 e:\temp\myenv> Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force

and then try again
	e:\temp\myenv> scripts\activate

make sure you can see following:
(myenv) PS e:\temp\myenv> 

Once the virtual environment is activated, the name of your virtual environment ("myenv" in our case)will appear on the left side of the terminal. This will let you know that the virtual environment is currently active.


once virtual environment gets activated, install Django 4.2 by giving following command

(myenv) PS e:\temp\myenv>pip install Django==4.2

it will take some time. make sure Django 4.2 is installed successfully inside myenv

now check again with "pip list" command :

(myenv) PS e:\temp\myenv> pip list

this time you will notice "Django 4.2" inside myenv folder.



now let's create a Django project 
create a project:

(myenv) PS e:\temp\myenv> django-admin startproject myproject

notice on the left side project view, "myproject" gets created inside "myenv"


make sure "myproject" project has been created inside "myenv" ( this can be checked inside VS code itself)

now inside this "myproject" we'll create our first app or application. One application atleast is required.

go to "myproject"

(myenv) PS E:\work\myenv> cd myproject
(myenv) PS E:\work\myenv\myproject> 

now create app inside this

(myenv) PS E:\work\myenv\myproject> django-admin startapp firstapp

make sure inside "myproject", "firstapp" gets created



right click on "firstapp"
	new python file
		urls.py

blank "urls.py" file will get created. Now copy the contents of "urls.py" file from "myproject" folder and paste it in "urls.py" of "firstapp" project.

inside "urlpatterns" of "urls.py" file of "firstapp" 

path=
	which has got 3 parameters
	1) the endpoint of the page
		if it is blank that means we want to display "Hello World" on the home page itself.
	2) on the execution of the app, which function should be called
		e.g. if you mention "views.home"
	it means definition of "home" function you will provide in "views.py" file.

if you get error for "views" ,
	from . import views

	3) name 
		which is name of page e.g.  home page

so , your "urls.py" inside "firstapp" should look like

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('',views.home,name='home page')
]


let's go to "views.py" and define "home" function

contents of "views.py" file:

from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

# Create your views here.

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("Welcome to first Django app")



now project "myproject" within which we have "firstapp", should know that we've created url.

so open "urls.py" of "myproject" and include the url we have given inside "urls.py" of "firstapp"

so "urls.py" of "myproject" should look like:

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path,include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('',include('firstapp.urls'))
]


now start the server

on pycharm terminal go to "e:\temp\myenv\myproject>" and type the following command:

python manage.py runserver

make sure you get following message:

	Django version 4.2, using settings 'a.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/


click this link and make sure you get following message in the browser:

	Welcome to first Django app
